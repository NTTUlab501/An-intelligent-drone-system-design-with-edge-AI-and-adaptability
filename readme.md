This work presents the ETAUS, an Edge and Trustworthy AI UAV System, as a mobile sensing platform for air quality monitoring. To meet the real-time processing demands and achieve adaptivity and scalability, ETAUS employs an FPGA device as the main hardware computing architecture rather than relying solely on a microprocessor or integrating with GPUs. ETAUS contains a neural engine that can execute our customized AI model for air quality index (AQI) level classification and a pre-trained model for detecting objects containing private information. ETAUS also incorporates a de-identification process, cryptographic functions and protection matrices to safeguard information and individuals' privacy. Furthermore, cryptographic functions and protection matrices are implemented as reconfigurable modules, which can accelerate processing and protect data privacy and be reconfigured as needed.
