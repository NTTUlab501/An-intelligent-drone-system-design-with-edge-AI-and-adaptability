This work was published in IECON’2025. It presents an edge AI-enabled UAV system based on FPGA for water quality monitoring, integrating hyperspectral imaging with onboard intelligence. The proposed system incorporates a band selection strategy to reduce the dimensionality of hyperspectral data and employs a dual convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for robust and accurate river pollution index (RPI) classification. To meet the real-time and energy efficiency requirements in industrial environments, FPGA-based hardware acceleration is utilized.
